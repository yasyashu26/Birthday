        Hey...Hii  <BR>
        I just wanna ask , how are you doing? Are you fine?? <BR>
        Though I dont wanna disturb you anymore, Im not texting you, But Incase you open this page, then read it.<BR><BR>
        
        Firstly, I wanna Apologize if I have done something wrong or any situation that me you think like that.<BR>
        I only had a good friend intention with you (A close friend you can say, nothing else) unless you told me that.<BR>
        so when a girl tells her feelings, its obvious if a boy likes her, will generate some feelings, thats what happened here.<BR>
        And on depth relaization, i felt its just an infactuation that made you think. I really dont posses any feelings unless u told me, <BR>
        But it was just a raised feeling untill i realized it. It wasn't love.<BR><BR>

        What I'm trying to tell is "I lost a friendüòÇ", now when I'm seeing a reel, though wanna share it with you, I'm not able to share it nor able to text you,<BR>
        I felt that will disturb you again. I was just thinking what if you had killed your feelings in the beginning only and all this wouldn't have happened.<BR>
        we would have just been a good friends. It would have been good. Now Lost a friendüòÇ. <BR><BR>

        I'm not telling this, so that we can be friends again, its not gonna happen. wanted to convey, so that you and me both feel better.<BR><BR>

        one last time, wanted to say "Idiot girl" to you as a friend onlyüòÇ. <BR>
        See I hope there's nothing wrong in this message. Just wanted to tell you remove this incidents from your brain as much as possible, so you will feel better. Because I'm good here, you being a overthinker , will think a lot. So dont do it and stop and concentrate on your project management goal. I will check your LinkedIn after 3 or 4 years , I should see a post stating "Happy to start my journey as a project manager" (i should see similar message in linkedIn) else will kill you.<BR><BR>

        All the Best for your futureüòÅ. I wrote this Just to make you feel better and you better not overthink.<BR>
        And I'm not gonna text you again. This will be my last communication with you indirectly...Hehehehee..  <BR><BR>

        And one more thing, I'll erase this content by evening, one of my friend birthday coming, so I need to design for him.<BR>
        So dont share this url with anyone, its my practice website, doing crazy crazy things hereüòÜ. <BR>
        you also delete this url from browser. I put whatsapp status just for you to see and convey thisüòù (so no need to worry), it will never flow from my side.<BR>

        Bye Bye ...Tata üëã<BR>
